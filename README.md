Abraham Solidity Practice

This repository contains my personal practice projects and smart contract exercises as I learn and build with Solidity and Foundry. It includes basic contract examples, testing, and deployment setups.

ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- Solidity
- Foundry
- Ubuntu WSL
- VS Code

ðŸ“‚ Structure

- pratice.sol â€“ Practice contract file
- simplestorage.sol â€“ Simple storage contract example
- test/ â€“ Test scripts for smart contracts
- script/ â€“ Deployment scripts
- foundry.toml â€“ Foundry configuration file

ðŸš€ Goals

- Strengthen my smart contract development skills  
- Build a solid foundation in Web3 backend  
- Prepare for real-world dApp development

## Foundry

**Foundry is a blazing fast, portable and modular toolkit for Ethereum application development written in Rust.**

Foundry consists of:

-   **Forge**: Ethereum testing framework (like Truffle, Hardhat and DappTools).
-   **Cast**: Swiss army knife for interacting with EVM smart contracts, sending transactions and getting chain data.
-   **Anvil**: Local Ethereum node, akin to Ganache, Hardhat Network.
-   **Chisel**: Fast, utilitarian, and verbose solidity REPL.
